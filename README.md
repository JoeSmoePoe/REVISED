# niepogoda's reroll script

This script automates the process of rerolling quests in ***Lee:// RPG***. It utilizes OCR to read from screen.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.10.6 or higher recommended)
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Windows operating system

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Python:**
   - If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Open a command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `reroll.py` and `requirements.txt`.
   - Run the following command to install required packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configure Screen Regions:**
   - Run `regions.py` by double-clicking on it. This script allows you to select specific regions on your screen where quests and reroll buttons are located.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to select regions for Quests 1, 2, 3, and their respective reroll buttons.
   - Save the regions when prompted. This will generate a `regions.json` file that `reroll.py` will use.

   **Make sure to leave some margins around the text and to not get the *Kill Quest* label in the area!**

4. **Configure `config.json`:**
   - Ensure `config.json` is present in the script's directory with the following parameters:
     - `minimum_chests`: Minimum number of chests required in each quest.
     - `delay`: Delay (in seconds) between each reroll.
     - `start_keybind`: Keyboard key to start the reroll process.
     - `kill_keybind`: Keyboard key to stop the script.

5. **Run the Script:**
   - Double-click on `reroll.py` to execute the script.
   - Once started, press `start_keybind` (configured in `config.json`) to begin the reroll process.
   - Press `kill_keybind` to stop the script at any time.

## Notes

- **Logging:** Detailed logs are written to `latest.log` in the script's directory. Check this file for information on script operations and any errors encountered.

## Troubleshooting

- If the script does not behave as expected, ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and configured.
- Check `latest.log` for error messages or warnings that may indicate issues with screen resolution or configuration files.
